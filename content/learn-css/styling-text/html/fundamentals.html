                    Said Tommy the Cat as he reeled back to clear whatever foreign matter
                    may have nestled its way into his mighty throat. Many a fat alley rat
                    had met its demise while staring point blank down the cavernous barrel of
                    this awesome prowling machine. Truly a wonder of nature this urban
                    predator — Tommy the cat had many a story to tell. But it was a rare
                    occasion such as this that he did.
